# Marvel: Ultimate War

## Introduction
"Marvel: Ultimate War" is a strategic two-player battle game where each player selects a team of three champions from the Marvel Universe to compete against the other. Set on a dynamic 5x5 grid battlefield, players must outmaneuver and outfight their opponents to emerge victorious by eliminating all opposing champions.

## Motivation
This project was developed to provide a deep dive into the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) through interactive and engaging gameplay. It incorporates various aspects of software development, including:
- **Advanced Programming Techniques**
- **Interactive GUI Development**
- **Client/Server Architecture**
- **Real-time Data Handling**

The game is designed to challenge the players' strategic thinking and programming skills, making it an ideal exercise for learning and applying OOP principles.
